# Selenium-SN_test
Setting up Test suites and Test cases for KPN B.V. ServiceNow instance.

This repository is also used as learning project for:
- Selenium IDE
- Selenium WebDriver (not yet started)
- GitHub and GitHub Desk (when possible I won't use Git Shell).
 
Topic for the testsuites and testcases will be regression test on CMDB functionality.
First tests will deal with being presence of all kind of elements:
- import tables for CMDB data loading
- left hand Configuration module menu items 
- Check presence of most important fields on CI forms

Future: 
- Test functionality as creating New CIs (per CI Class)
- Test BRs on CI classes
